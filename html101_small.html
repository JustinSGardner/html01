                This is an exercise about nesting div tags. This div contains this text and the div tag below.

                        Hi! Our parent div was just talking about us. Please make sure you indent this example appropriately.

            Here's what I like about lists:
            <li>
                They're useful for displaying lists of stuff
            </li>
            <li>
                That's about it
            </li>
            <li>
                I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            Here's a couple ways you can express yourself
            <li>
                If you want to sound normal, just use a regular li tag here
            </li>
            <li>
                If you want to sound <em>interesting, try the italics tag</em>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>If you want to sound annoying, try the bold tag</strong>
            </li>
        </ul>
